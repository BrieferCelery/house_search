# PURPOSE AND SCOPE

House Search is an application that allows the user to research the rental
 property market in the Queensland area. The user will input the suburb, 
 postcode and maximum price and get back results that match their input.
 The application is packaged as a friendly helper in order to guide the user
 to their preferred result.
 
 Searching for the right home can be daunting and some may feel uncomfortable
 doing it for the first time. In order to solve this problem the user should
 be provided with a helpful environment to help guide their decisions.
 House Search is targeted towards individuals looking into the Queensland
 rental property market for the first time and would not know where to start.
 Users get guided prompts to assist in narrowing the scope of their search thus,
 solving the problem of getting a first time user comfortable searching for 
 properties in Queensland.
 
 This application was built using the Ruby programming language and third party
 gems. This project aims to implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) practises,
 test-driven development, source-control, planning and design apply the styles
  and conventions of Ruby and run without error.

##MOTIVATION

When looking at possible ideas for this project I narrowed the scope around 
data as this was a topic in technology that I was interested in.

This yielded many interesting ideas mainly around statistical data and web 
data. Statistical data seemed interesting as there are many third party 
libraries that can perform sophisticated functions on large data-sets. Web 
data was an interesting proposition because I wanted to challenge myself
to be able to extract and format web data.
Ultimately, I chose to centre this project around web data and Queensland 
real estate. The task was a simple but challenging enough - extract and format
data from domain.com.au and package it into a user-friendly experience.

##FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY
##### Search Results
The core feature of this app is a search tool that returns filtered results
according to the user's input. The user will input the suburb, postcode
and maximum price they are willing to pay. Under the hood the application
takes the user's input and returns results based on their input.
